### Experience

Throughout my journey as a Software Engineer, I have extensively explored various domains and utilized C++ in diverse areas to discover my true passion.

One of my notable experiences involved creating windowed applications using the Qt framework. It was fascinating to develop interactive and user-friendly interfaces, leveraging the power of C++ and Qt's extensive library of widgets and tools. This exposure allowed me to enhance my skills in building robust desktop applications.

In addition to my desktop application development, I delved into embedded development, both as a hobby and professionally. Working in the Automotive industry provided me with valuable opportunities to contribute to the finalization of the Android OS itself and to work on embedded devices. This involved a combination of C++ and Java, utilizing technologies like JNA (Java Native Access) and JNI (Java Native Interface) to bridge the gap between the two languages. It was exciting to work on optimizing the performance of these systems and ensuring seamless integration between the software and hardware components.

During my tenure as a back-end developer, I had the responsibility of handling large datasets, often containing up to 100 thousand data units. This required me to write high-performance code that could efficiently process and manipulate the data while ensuring minimal server resource usage. I enjoyed the challenge of optimizing queries and solving complex problems, as it allowed me to showcase my skills in designing efficient algorithms and leveraging the power of C++ to achieve optimal performance.

Throughout my experiences, I discovered my deep interest in both embedded development and back-end development. These areas provided me with challenging projects that fueled my personal and professional growth. I thrive in environments that present difficult problems to solve, as they allow me to constantly push my boundaries and acquire new skills.

In conclusion, my journey as a Software Engineer has allowed me to explore various domains, ranging from windowed applications to embedded systems and back-end development. I have discovered my passion for embedded development and back-end programming through challenging projects that have honed my skills and expanded my expertise. Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my professional growth and explore new technologies and languages, such as Haskell, to further broaden my horizons.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

**OpenGreenhouse** is an exciting endeavor where I am developing an open-source, automated greenhouse system specifically designed for growing microgreens, spinach, and strawberries. With a focus on hardware and software development, OpenGreenhouse aims to provide an accessible solution for indoor gardening enthusiasts to create their own optimal growing environments.

In addition to OpenGreenhouse, I am also working on [**SQL-Tools**](https://github.com/cyb3rmavka/SQL-tools), a console application that simplifies the process of writing SQL queries for table updates. By automating query generation and offering customization options, SQL-Tools streamlines the editing of complex queries, saving valuable time and effort when updating large datasets.
